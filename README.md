# TelloDrone_Tracking
Tello Drone Tracking Project by Tianyi Li

Why did I start this project?

After taking robotic classes about mobile robots, robot arm, and robot kinematics & dynanmics 
I realized I lack experience and knowlegde in computer vision and machine learning, which are crucial topics in the current industry. Therefore I thought maybe I can use the Tello Drone to get familiar with these topics. I have only done some simple CV and ML assigments for homeworks, but doing a personal project is more challanging and fun.

Goal : Implement face tracking and recognition for Tello Drone. Also follows the user around.

FOLDERS

Tello_default : uses the built in open source library for Tello 

Tello_unofficial : self made functions for communication between computer and Tello, video streaming, and getting states.
